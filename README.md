# DataScientist-IDXPartners-VirtualInternship-Rakamin
As a Data Scientist at ID/X Partners, you will be involved in a project for a lending company (multifinance) aiming to improve the accuracy in assessing and managing credit risk. This enhancement will help optimize their business decisions and reduce potential losses.

Your task is to develop a machine learning model to predict credit risk based on a provided dataset, which includes data on both approved and rejected loans. The project will involve several stages: Data Understanding, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Data Modelling, and Evaluation.

## Project Stages

### Data Understanding
- Analyze the provided dataset and summarize its structure, including the number of rows and columns.
- Identify and understand each attribute or column in the dataset.
- Conduct an initial exploration of variable distributions, descriptive statistics, and general patterns in the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the data using charts and plots to understand the relationships between variables.
- Analyze the correlations between features in the dataset.
- Perform univariate and bivariate analyses to gain deeper insights into the data.

### Data Preparation
- Handle missing values by either removing them or using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Address outliers if necessary, either by removing or adjusting their values.
- Encode categorical variables if required.
- Scale or normalize numerical features if needed.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Data Modelling
- Choose appropriate machine learning models based on the type of problem and objectives.
- Train the model on the training set.
- Tune model parameters using techniques like cross-validation or grid search.
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or ROC-AUC.
- Check for overfitting or underfitting and take appropriate actions.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on the separate test data set.
- Analyze the obtained evaluation metrics to assess how well the model performs.
- Summarize the evaluation results and present them clearly.

## Hints

### Use Data Dictionary as Main Guide
- Utilize the data dictionary as the primary source of information to understand each attribute in the dataset.
- Use the definitions and descriptions in the data dictionary to interpret variables and identify possible values.

### Initial Data Quality Check
- Perform an initial data quality check to detect common issues such as missing values, outliers, or duplicates.
- Use simple visualization techniques like histograms or scatter plots to identify suspicious patterns.

### Focus on Deep Understanding of the Problem
- Explore the problem's background thoroughly to understand the context comprehensively.
- Use insights from stakeholders and domain knowledge to guide your data analysis.

### Creative EDA
- Don't be limited to standard visualizations; try exploring various types of charts and plots to uncover interesting patterns.
- Use techniques like clustering or factor analysis to gain deeper insights into the data structure.

### Experiment with Different Models
- Try various types of models and algorithms to find the best fit for your data.
- Perform careful parameter tuning to enhance model performance.

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Always document every step taken in the data analysis process, including model selection, parameters used, and evaluation results.
- Ensure you explain the reasoning behind each decision made in your documentation.

### Utilize Available Tools and Resources
- Leverage online tools and resources such as tutorials, documentation, and discussion forums to deepen your understanding of data analysis and modeling techniques.
- Don't hesitate to seek help from instructors or peers if you encounter difficulties or have questions.

### Regular Evaluation and Review
- Periodically evaluate your progress and review project objectives to ensure you stay on track.
- Use feedback from stakeholders and team members to help refine and improve your solution.

### Identify Credit Performance Columns
- Start by identifying columns in the dataset that describe the credit performance of borrowers.
- Examine the content of these columns carefully to see if they clearly indicate good or bad credit status. If so, labels can be directly assigned.

### Determine Labels
- If the column content clearly indicates credit status, assign labels according to predefined categories (e.g., GOOD or BAD).

### Review Column Content
- If the column content does not directly indicate credit status, review the column content in more detail.

### Understand Payment History
- Understand the meaning of the data in these columns and consider the credit payment history of each borrower.

### Consider Payment Delays
- Based on the credit payment history, determine whether borrowers fall into the good or bad category. Typically, this can be determined based on historical payment delays.
